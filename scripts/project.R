# From the first email with data

# I have attached one hospital sites data above for the year 2018 (will text
# password as requested).  The data is separated into patient level (‘all data’),
# day and night, and also into daily level, again split into day and night.
# The other three hospital sites data will be organized in a similar manner.
#
# What we are focusing on is how staffing levels affect Patient Experience
# Times(PET), Time to Triage(TTT), and wait to be seen.  We have included both
# actual staffing levels and rostered, taking the actual as the number of staff
# present during that shift.
#
# Included within the dayshift data is number of patients on trolleys for that
# shift (TrolleyGAR). This is also of interest to us and its fluctuations given
# different staffing levels.
#
# We were considering a logistic regression model, but would be very interested
# in any and all suggestions you may have.
#
# Another element of our project is forecasting number of patients that will use
# ED services, so as to roster an appropriate number of staff on any given day.
# To formulate this projection of future staffing requirements, is there any
# additional data you may need? We can look into obtaining 2017’s admissions and
# any other pertinent information.



# From the email with the hospital site data
# I have attached the data sets from each of the
# four pilot sites : Hospital 4,5,6,7.
#
# Each file pertains to one hospital site and includes patient experience times,
# time to triage, wait time, patient characteristics (triage category etc.) and
# staff levels (rostered and actual) for day shifts and nights shifts.
#
# In areas where # is present or where there is a blank this represents missing
# data that we are unable to attain from the hospitals.
#
# Just a few points of clarification:
#
#   •	Hospital 7 is a Local Injury Unit and hence the data available for this
# site is minimal.
#
# •	In relation to Hospital 4- approximately 7,921 patients are classified as
# “eye treatment”- these patients are not treated in the ED but instead receive
# treatment within a separate eye clinic area however, this data from both sites
# is collected in tandem.
#
# •	In relation to Hospital 6 (Matter): some patients are classified as being treated in
# “ED Clinic Other”- this refers to a medic run clinic that is within the ED but
# not staffed by ED nurses. It usually tends to relate to patients who are
# being reviewed or followed up with. We are presently working on compiling the
# staff numbers for this site but will forward within the coming days.
#
# •	The TrolleyGAR variable relates to the number of patients that were recorded
# as being on trolleys on that particular day.
#
# Abbreviations used:
# LOS=Length of Stay
# PET=Patient Experience Time
# TTT=Time to Triage
# ANP=Advanced Nurse Practitioner
